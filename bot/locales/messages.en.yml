    Top o' the mornin' to ya! 🍀

    Welcome to ShamrockSeats! I'm here to tweak Lady Luck in your favor. 🍀✨

    With a wee bit of leprechaun magic, I'll reserve every other seat on the plane, so when you check in, you'll "randomly" get that seat you fancy! 😉💺

    Type /reserve to start, or /cancel if you've had a change of heart. Let's put a twist on your fortune! ☘️

    Just a heads-up: This magic only works on flights open for check-in — that's from 24 hours to 2.5 hours before departure! 🕒✈️

  reserve_start: |
    Right so! Let's get this craic started! 🎉

    What's the 3-letter code of the airport you're flyin' out from? (e.g., DUB):

  invalid_origin: |
    Ah, that's not quite right! 🤔 

    Could ya give me a valid 3-letter airport code? Think DUB for Dublin:

  ask_destination: |
    Grand! Now, where's the end of your rainbow? 🌈 

    Give me the 3-letter code of your arrival airport (e.g., JFK):

  invalid_destination: |
    Whoops! That doesn't seem correct. 🧐 

    I need a valid 3-letter airport code, like JFK for New York:

  invalid_airport_code: |
    The airport code you entered doesn't exist.

    Let's try again shall we?

  ask_time: |
    Brilliant! ⏰ What time's your flight leavin'? 
    Use the 24-hour format (e.g., 14:30):

  invalid_time: |
    Hmm, that time doesn't look proper! 🕒 
    Let's try again using HH:MM format, like 14:30:

  checking_seats: |
    Hold onto your lucky charms! 🌟 
    I'm checking for open seats...

  one_seat_left: |
    Well, kiss the Blarney Stone! Only one seat left unreserved! 
    Grab it quick before it disappears! 🎟️

  pick_seat: |
    I'm about to sprinkle some Irish luck on your flight! 🍀✨
    I'll reserve every other seat, so you'll "randomly" get a better one when you check in! 😉

    Where do you fancy seatin'?

  no_seats_selected: |
    You haven't selected any seats. Please choose at least one seat.

  seat_selection_instructions: |
    Seats you'd like me to leave be: %{selected_seats}

    If there's any other seats you'd rather I leave alone (perhaps for a friend or a wee leprechaun), tap to select/deselect them. 

    Otherwise, tap '%{done_button}' and we'll be off! 🛫

  snatching_seats: |
    Brilliant! I'll reserve every other seat except for %{selected_seats}! 
    Time to fiddle with fate! 🍀✨

  reserving_seats: |
    Casting a charm or two... ⏳✨ 

    This won't take longer than a jig at a ceilidh! (1-2 mins)

  reservation_complete: |
    All done! May the road rise up to meet ya, and may you get the seat you fancy! 🎉🍀

  check_in: |
    Check in now with random seat allocation, you'll find Lady Luck has been kind! 

    Safe travels, and may the wind be at your back! 🛫🍀

  cancel: |
    No bother at all! I've canceled the magic. 
    If you change your mind, I'll be here, sippin' me tea! ☕️
    Use /reserve to summon me again

  flight_not_found: |
    Hmm, can't seem to find that flight. 🧐

    Is your flight within the check-in window (24h - 2.5h before departure)? The magic only works during that time! ⏳✨

    Maybe check your details and give it another whirl with /reserve.

  flight_sold_out: |
    Oh dear! That flight's busier than a Dublin pub on a Friday night! 🍻 
    Try a different flight or time, perhaps?

  script_error: |
    Well, that's odd! Something went awry on our end. 
    Care to give it another go with /reserve? 😅

  flight_info_changed: |
    Looks like the flight details have shifted like the Irish weather! 🌦️ 
    Let's start fresh with /reserve.

  something_wrong: |
    That didn't go as planned! 
    Let's try again with /reserve and see if the luck o' the Irish is with us! 🤞

  done_button: "All Set!"
